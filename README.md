Boole Game is a word game, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle for details

The code uses https://en.wiktionary.org API for word validation. 
Due to hugh possibility of 16 dices word combination, remote word validation becomes slow and troublesome. Therefore in the initial version
it limits to 4 dices with letters 'P', 'A', 'T', 'E'.
There is a fake word validator that validate to true with configuable percentage.

working in progress, more to come.
